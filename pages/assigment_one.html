        <h2>Assignment 1: BEM Methodology</h2>
        <a class="assigment__link" href="https://advancedcss2024.github.io/idg1293-2024-oblig1-group2/">Link to the Assigment 1</a>
        <p>In this first assignment, I utilized the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to enhance my understanding of structured CSS naming conventions. 
            The design system of the finn.no webpage played a crucial role in facilitating this process. It provided clear guidelines for elements such as primary buttons, secondary buttons,
            and a simple footer with links and inputs, making it easier to define blocks, elements, and modifiers.</p>
            <h3>Application in the Assigment</h3>
            <p>The use of a design system helped me consistently apply BEM naming conventions throughout the assignment. Here are some specific examples from my code:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p> Blocks: The main structural components such as .main, .footer, and .form are clearly defined as blocks. 
                    They served as foundational elements of the page layout.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Elements: Within these blocks, elements are defined to structure the content further. For instance, .main__section--left, .form__input-container1, 
                    and .footer__link-item are elements that build upon their respective blocks, ensuring a logical hierarchy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Modifiers: Modifiers like .main__section--left are used to create variations of blocks or elements, adding specificity and flexibility to the design without disrupting the overall structure.
                        Overall, the integration of the design system with BEM allowed for a more organized and maintainable codebase. By having predefined styles for primary and secondary buttons, 
                        and a structured layout for the footer, I was able to streamline the development process. 
                        This approach not only improved the clarity and readability of my code but also made it easier to manage and update as needed.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Using BEM helped in creating a more organized and maintainable codebase. The predefined styles for primary and secondary buttons, 
                along with a structured layout for the footer, streamlined the development process. This approach improved the clarity and readability of my code, 
                making it easier to manage and update.</p>
            <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
            <p>One area I could improve is giving class names to paragraphs to make the CSS code more efficient. 
                This would allow for better targeting of specific paragraphs within a block-element structure.
