                <h3>General Reflection</h3>
                <p>The primary goal of this web portfolio was to demonstrate the application of advanced CSS techniques, specifically focusing 
                    on BEM methodology, SVGs, CSS drawing, animations, and web interactions. The changes I made were aimed at enhancing the structure, readability, and maintainability 
                    of the code while ensuring the portfolio meets the required standards for presentation and functionality.</p>
                <h4>JavaScript Enhancements:</h4>
                 <p>I gained deeper insights into JavaScript functionalities, such as implementing and using 
                    the Intersection Observer API and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for advanced animations. 
                    These tools helped in creating more interactive and dynamic web experiences.
                    
                    
                    <h4>Responsive Design Principles:</h4>
                    <p>Learning to use vh and vw units improved the responsiveness of my designs. I realized that responsiveness isn't just about avoiding horizontal scrollbars 
                    but also ensuring that fonts and interactive elements are suitable for all devices.
                    I also learned along, all though the design systems may have boring design, at the begining for instance when leanring BEM methodology
                    it can be really helpfull. Reduced Motion:
                    Incorporating reduced motion preferences into my designs taught me the importance of accessibility and accommodating users with motion sensitivities.
                    </p>
                    <p>SCSS for Cleaner Code:
                      Utilizing SCSS along with BEM methodology significantly cleaned up my code. SCSS variables, nesting, and mixins made the CSS more modular and maintainable. 
                     HTML Structure Importance:
                     I discovered that a well-structured HTML is crucial for responsive design. 
                     Issues with responsiveness often stemmed from missing or misplaced elements in the HTML structure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>GitHub and Branching:</h4>
                    Working with GitHub and managing branches taught me version control and collaboration. 
                    It was challenging to adapt to different coding styles and structures while ensuring that merges did not break the overall project.
                    
                    <h4>Team Collaboration:</h4>
                    Adapting to team dynamics and coordinating with others on shared tasks highlighted the importance of clear communication 
                    and consistent coding practices to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth integration.
